## Rock Paper Scissors 

### Description

In this project I will follow Codecademy's tutorial and write a program that will play rock paper scissors. I will then create the rest of the Javascript interactivity (with query selectors), HTML and CSS styling myself to develop it into a fully functioning application.


### How it works

Look in rock-paper-scissors.js for detailed comments of the program functionality.
