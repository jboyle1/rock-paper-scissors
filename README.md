## Rock Paper Scissors 

### Description

In this project I will follow Codecademy's tutorial and write a program that will play rock paper scissors in the output console. I will then use my developemnt knowledge to create the rest of the Javascript interactivity (with DOM query selectors), HTML and CSS styling and develop it into a fully functioning application.


### How it works

Look in rock-paper-scissors(test-with-console).js for detailed comments of the program functionality.
